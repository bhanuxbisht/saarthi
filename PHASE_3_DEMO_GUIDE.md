## üîß Technical Deep Dive (If Judges Ask)

### **How Does the ML Work?**

```javascript
// 1. Load Universal Sentence Encoder
const model = await use.load();

// 2. Convert text to embeddings
const userBioEmbedding = await model.embed(profile.bio);
const jobDescEmbedding = await model.embed(job.description);

// 3. Calculate cosine similarity
const similarity = cosineSimilarity(userBioEmbedding, jobDescEmbedding);

// 4. Weighted scoring
const finalScore = 
  (similarity * 0.70) +        // Semantic match
  (skillsMatch * 0.20) +       // Skills overlap
  (accessibilityFit * 0.10);   // Workplace fit
```

### **Why Universal Sentence Encoder?**
- Pre-trained on billions of sentences
- Captures semantic meaning, not just keywords
- Works in 100+ languages
- Optimized for similarity tasks
- 512D embeddings = rich representations

### **Performance Optimization**
- Model loaded once, cached globally
- Job embeddings cached after first calculation
- Parallel processing with `Promise.all`
- Sub-2 second match time for 30 jobs

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Model Loading Slow**
**Solution**: First load takes 3-5 seconds (downloads 30MB model). Subsequent loads are instant (cached).

**Demo Tip**: Pre-load before demo by refreshing page once.

### **Issue 2: Match Scores Too High/Low**
**Expected**: 70-95% for good matches, 40-60% for poor matches.

**If all scores are similar**: Profile might be too generic. Use detailed bio with specific skills.

### **Issue 3: No "Why This Matches"**
**Cause**: Profile not created yet.

**Solution**: Complete profile form first, then matches will show explanations.
