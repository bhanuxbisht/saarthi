## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Translation Shows Same Text

**Check Console Logs:**
Look for `=== TRANSLATION RESPONSE ===` section.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Same language selected** - Console will show `"Same language - skipping translation"`
   - ‚úÖ Solution: Change "Translate To" to different language

2. **API Error** - Console shows error message
   - ‚úÖ Solution: Check internet connection
   - ‚úÖ Try shorter sentence (API has 500 char limit)

3. **Low quality match** - Console shows `"Match: 0.1"`
   - ‚úÖ This is expected for rare phrases
   - ‚úÖ Try common phrases first

### Issue: Microphone Not Working

**Error: "not-allowed"**
- Browser didn't grant permission
- Fix: Click lock icon ‚Üí Allow microphone ‚Üí Refresh

**Error: "audio-capture"**
- No microphone detected
- Fix: Check if microphone is connected/enabled

**Error: "no-speech"**
- You're not speaking loud enough
- Fix: Speak clearly and closer to microphone

### Issue: Translation Taking Too Long

- Free API can be slow during high traffic
- Wait 5-10 seconds
- Console will show "Translation unavailable" if timeout

### Issue: Speak Button Not Working

**Check:**
1. Is there text in Translation box?
2. Is isSpeaking stuck at true?
3. Console error?

**Fix:**
- Click "Stop" first
- Clear and try again
- Check browser supports Web Speech (Chrome/Edge best)

## üéâ Next Steps After Testing

Once all tests pass:

1. **Document your testing** - Note which languages you tested
2. **Create a demo video** - Show voice recognition working
3. **Take screenshots** - Especially of different language translations
4. **Prepare for demo** - Practice speaking clearly
5. **Push to GitHub** - When you're ready (you asked to wait)

## üí° Pro Tips for Best Results

- **Speak clearly** at normal pace (not too fast/slow)
- **Use common phrases** first to test accuracy
- **Wait for confidence score** before speaking again
- **Check console** if something seems wrong
- **Test in quiet environment** for best recognition
- **Use Chrome/Edge** for best compatibility
