## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: AI/ML Implementation Plan**

### **Phase-by-Phase Strategy:**
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 (Voice Assistant):** COMPLETE - 100% REAL AI/ML
  - Web Speech API (REAL)
  - Translation API (REAL)
  - Text-to-Speech (REAL)
  
- ÔøΩ **Phase 2 (Accessibility):** NEXT - No AI needed
  - Font controls, high contrast, color blind modes
  - Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
  - Pure UI/UX features
  
- ü§ñ **Phase 3 (Job Matching):** WILL IMPLEMENT REAL ML HERE
  - **Install TensorFlow.js** - Universal Sentence Encoder
  - **Real semantic similarity** - Calculate actual match scores
  - **No fake scores** - All calculations will be real AI
  - **Client-side ML** - Runs in browser, no backend needed
  
- üìä **Phase 4 (Integration):** Analytics & dashboard
  - Mock data OK for demo

**Bottom Line:** Voice = REAL AI ‚úÖ | Accessibility = No AI needed ‚úÖ | Jobs = ADD REAL AI when building ‚úÖ
