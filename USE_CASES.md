NEXUS speaks out loud: "What is your name?"
```

### **Q2: Is the data pre-described/fake?**

**What we use:**
1. **Web Speech API** (Google's ML) - Voice recognition
2. **MyMemory Translation API** - Real translation

**What happened:**
```
❌ WRONG SETUP:
   Input Language: English 🇺🇸  (but you spoke Hindi!)
   Target Language: Hindi 🇮🇳

```

**FIX APPLIED:** Now defaults to Hindi → English (more common in India)
